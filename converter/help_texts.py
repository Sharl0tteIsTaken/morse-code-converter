explain_text = "International Morse code is composed of five elements:\n\
dot:            short mark, dot or di: one time unit long.\n\
dash:           long mark, dash or dah: three time units long.\n\
inter gap:      inter-element gap between the dots and dashs within a character: one unit long.\n\
short gap:      short gap (between letters): three time units long.\n\
medium gap:     medium gap (between words): seven time units long.\n\
\n\
a `time unit` in this context is a letter.\n\
these five elements will be referred to as `configuration`\n\
when describing multiple set of elements will be referred to as `configurations`\n\
\n\
example:        convert text: 'test msg' into morse code will be:\n\
'-   .   . . .   -       - -   . . .   - - .'\n\
 ^   ^    ^          ^               ^\n\
 |   ||   |          |               |\n\
 dash dot inter gap  medium gap      short gap\n\
\n\
in other words:\n\
'-   .   . . .   -       - -   . . .   - - .'\n\
't...e...  s  ...t....... m ...  s  ...  g  '\n\
(here uses '.' to replace spaces for clarification)\n\
t converts into '-', this is `dash`\n\
e converts into '.', this is `dot`\n\
s converts into '. . .', with a space in between morse codes, the space is `inter gap`\n\
spaces(three) in between two letter(t and e in test) is `short gap`\n\
spaces(seven) in between two word(test and msg) is `medium gap`\n\
